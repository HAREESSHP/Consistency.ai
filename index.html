                    <p class="founder-bio">
                        With a deep passion for student growth and technology-driven learning, I created Consistency AI to tackle one of the biggest challenges students face today — the lack of clarity and the struggle to stay consistent.
After years of mentoring, guiding, and observing students closely, I realized that success doesn't depend on talent alone. It depends on having the right direction and the discipline to stay on track.

Consistency AI was built to bring both of these elements together.
The platform blends intelligent recommendations, structured guidance, and personalized support to help students learn with confidence, focus, and long-term consistency.

My mission is simple:
Empower students to learn smarter, stay consistent, and unlock their full potential through AI-driven clarity. Through JatayuvAI, I'm extending this vision to build intelligent solutions that empower learning and growth across the board.
